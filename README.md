# Complex Numbers

## Introduction

This repository is meant to be a convenient calculator for dealing with complex numbers, which I will refer to as _C_. It resulted from me noticing how many times I'd have to compute something by hand and how much I'd like to abstract this away. I was curious to see if a program was capable of computing complicated integrals in _C_ -- the answer, it seems, is that it's too complicated.

Of course this is not meant to replace any learning. It is imperative that people learn the theory for why these computations are true before they use a calculator. The skills one learns from studying _C_ manifest in many ways, both directly in learning new math and recognizing structures, and indirectly by developing the critical thinking skills to appreciate the depths of the world. This calculator should be useful for people that already know the theory and have to do the computations.
